## A free dinosaur mod for 1.20.1 and 1.21.1, inspired by the classic JurassiCraft experience – no paywalls, no nonsense.


### 📦 About the Mod:
  Jurassic Revived is a fan-made dinosaur mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 and 1.21.1, inspired by the gameplay and features of the original JurassiCraft mod.

  With the official version locked behind a Patreon paywall and older builds removed from public access, Jurassic Revived keeps the classic fossil-to-dino pipeline alive — completely free, community-accessible, and regularly updated for modern Minecraft.

### 💡 Why Jurassic Revived?
  When JurassiCraft went private and its downloads disappeared, this mod was made to continue the legacy — for the community, by the community. Jurassic Revived offers the same immersive dinosaur gameplay — without restrictions.

### The Creative History of Jurassic Craft

#### 🦖 Behind the Scenes – What Really Happened
- Jurassic Craft began as a collaborative passion project, but the creators involved all had very different creative styles and priorities.

- In the beginning, the energy was spontaneous and shared—everyone contributed freely without central leadership or strict vision.

- As the series gained popularity, creative tensions emerged:

- Some wanted to keep it fun and chaotic, others pushed for structure and realism.
    There were unspoken disagreements over who was “driving” the project creatively.
    Conflicts weren’t public, but decisions were increasingly made individually, not as a group.
    Over time, the collaboration faded. The project split into smaller, personal offshoots, often with little connection to the original dynamic.

- Reunions became unlikely—not because of open conflict, but due to creative drift and personal distance.
